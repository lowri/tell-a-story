+ Open this trinket: <a href="http://jumpto.cc/web-story" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/web-story</a>. 

	The project should look like this:

+ You might remember from the 'Happy Birthday' project that webpage content goes in the `<body>` of the HTML document.

	Go to line 7 of the code, and you should see the webpage content, which is inside `<body>` and `</body>` tags.

+ Can you tell which tags are used to create the different parts of the webpage?

	+ `<h1>` is a __heading__. You can use the numbers 1 to 6 to create headings of different sizes;
	+ `<div>` is short for __division__, and is a way of grouping stuff together. In this webpage, you'll use it to group together all the stuff for each part of your story;
	+ `<img>` is an __image__;
	+ `<p>` is a __paragraph__ of text.
