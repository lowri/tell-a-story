## Editing your story

Let's start by editing the HTML content and CSS style of the story webpage.

+ Open this trinket: [jumpto.cc/web-story](http://jumpto.cc/web-story){:target="_blank"}.

The project should look like this:

Web page content goes in the `<body>` of the HTML document.

+ Go to line 7 of the code, and you should see the webpage content, which is inside `<body>` and `</body>` tags.

+ See if you can work out which tags are used to create the different parts of the webpage.

+ `<h1>` is a __heading__. You can use the numbers 1 to 6 to create headings of different sizes;
+ `<div>` is short for __division__, and is a way of grouping stuff together. In this webpage, you'll use it to group together all the stuff for each part of your story;
+ `<img>` is an __image__;
+ `<p>` is a __paragraph__ of text.
