## Challenge: Make some changes
Edit the HTML and the CSS code to customise your webpage.

![screenshot](images/story-changes.png)

You can alter the colours used in the webpage, and you can also use fonts like <span style="font-family: Arial;">Arial</span>, <span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Comic Sans MS</span>, <span style="font-family: Impact;">Impact</span> and <span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Tahoma</span>.

You can find more CSS colour names at [jumpto.cc/colours](http://jumpto.cc/colours){:target="_blank"}.

If you need more help, you can use the [Happy Birthday](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/happy-birthday){:target="_blank"} project to help you.
