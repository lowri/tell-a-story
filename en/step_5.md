## Telling your story

Let's add a second part to your story.



+ Go to line 15 of the code, and add in another set of `<div>` and `</div>` start and end tags. This will create a new box for the next part of your story.

+ Add a paragraph of text inside your new `<div>` tag.

	```
	<p>More text here!</p>
	```

+ Finally, you can add an image to your new box, by adding this code inside your `<div>` tag:

	```
	<img src="">
	```

	Notice that `<img>` tags are a bit different to other tags, as they don't have an end tag.

+ For HTML images, you need to add the __source__ of the image, inside the speech marks. 

	Click the image icon to see the images available for your story.

+ Find the name of an image you want to add, for example `buildings.png`. You can then click `index.html` to get back to your code.

+ You can then add the name of the image between the speech marks in your `<img>` tag.

	```
	<img src="buildings.png">
	```
